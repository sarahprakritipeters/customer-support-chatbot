Yes, the PartSelect Number: PS10065979 is the correct adjuster kit that you will need to repair the unit. I hope this helps!', 'Hi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps.
