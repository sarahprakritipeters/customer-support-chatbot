In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.\\nPrice: $90.73\\nStock: In Stock\\nProduct_link: /PS11701542-Whirlpool-EDR1RXD1-Refrigerator-Ice-and-Water-Filter.htm?SourceCode=18\\nSymptoms Fixed: Not dispensing water | Ice maker not making ice | Ice maker won’t dispense ice | Leaking\\nReplacements List: [\\'AP5982535\\', \\'9900\\', \\'9981\\', \\'FILTER 1\\', \\'FILTER1\\', \\'W10217316\\', \\'W10291030\\', \\'W10295370\\', \\'W10295370A\\', \\'W10569758\\', \\'W10569760\\', \\'W10569761\\', \\'W10735398\\']\\nProduct Info: Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Kenmore.\\nAverage Product Rating: 4.8\\nAverage Repair Rating: 4.4 / 5.0, 15 reviews.\\nQueries: [\\'Your water filter w10295370a , what all does this filter out of the water that passes through it ?This is for model number Model number not found\\', \\'I have this Whirlpool and can not find where water filter is.This is for model number WRS325FDAM04\\', \\'The description says the filter is on the left bottom behind a kick plate; however, mine is located on the top right  that is in the refrigerator section.

       " Document(page_content=': 2\\nPart_Number: PS16542496\\nManufacturer_Part_Number: WE03X29897\\nManufacturer: GE\\nTitle: Fridge BELT DRIVE\\nDescription: This Drive Belt is 89.5\" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.\\nPrice: $36.13\\nStock: In Stock\\nProduct_link: /PS16542496-GE-WE03X29897-BELT-DRIVE.htm?SourceCode=18\\nSymptoms Fixed: Noisy | Drum Not Spinning | Won’t Start\\nReplacements List: [\\'WE12M0022\\', \\'WE12M22\\', \\'WE12M29\\', \\'WE12M33\\', \\'WE12X21574\\']\\nProduct Info: General Electric, Hotpoint, Kenmore.\\nAverage Product Rating: 4.8\\nAverage Repair Rating: 2.8 / 5.0, 65 reviews.\\nQueries: [\\'is motor supposed to stay running after pressing start button with the belt offThis is for model number GTDP180EDOWW\\', \\'I have a very bad squeaking noise happening when dryer is running.

If you are replacing the front bearing slides in your dryer you will need 2 lower slides WE1M504, which are white. You will also need two upper slides WE1M1067, which are green. Good luck with this repair.', 'Hi Glenn. You will need to order 2 of the white slides and 2 of the green slides. They are sold individually . Hope this helps!', 'Hi Nina, great question. Changing your front bearings would be your first step as worn ones can cause loud noises throughout the drying cycle. To change the upper bearings, you will need 2 of WE1M504 and 2 of WE1M1067. If you decide to also change the rear bearing which would be the second most common cause for the noise, the part would be WE25M40. Let us know if you have any further questions.', 'Hi Bobby,\\\\n\\\\nThank you for your inquiry. Your belt could be the issue. If it has worn down so much that maybe it is slipping against the pulley. However it is more likely that you will have to replace either your bearing slides or your pulley. I would check all of these parts to see which one of them are causing your problem. They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise. Good luck with your repair.', 'Hello Calista, thanks for getting in touch. You will know to replace the front bearings or the support if you see any visible damage. Wear is normal, but if the parts are damaged in any way they should be replaced. I hope this helps!', 'Hi Jim, Thank you for the question. You can check the belt to make sure it is not wore out and and preventing the drum to turn as it should.You can also check the Rear Drum Bearing for wear. Make sure the appliance is getting proper air flow. Clean the Lint Trap Duct Assembly and the Air Vents. You can use a Multi Meter to test the High Limit Thermostat and the Bias Thermostat as well for proper continuity. Hope this helps!', 'Hi Juan,\\\\nThank you for your question.  The squeaking noise you are hearing is likely a worn drum support roller that needs to be replaced.  It is always recommended to replace both of them at the same time.  If your dryer is taking a long time to dry and the front seal I would recommend replacing it as this is likely causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!', 'Hi Hansel, \\\\n\\\\nThank you for your question. These parts are sold individually. Be sure to check your model number and make sure that you need four of these ones and not two of these slides and two of a different kind. Good luck with your repair.', 'Hi Michael, Thank you for the question. The appliance needs 2 of the white and 2 of the green in order to operate properly. Hope this helps!', 'Hi Denny,\\\\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drive belt, the idler pulley wheel, the complete duct trap assembly, the idler arm, the bearing retainer and the bearing slides.  I hope this helps.

It replaces the dryer\\'s front drum slide to allow for easier movement.  You\\'ll know if this part is an issue if your dryer is unable to tumble properly or is very noisy. Damage can come from regular use. As the slides start to break down it may cause your dryer to make noise or not dry clothes in the usual amount of time. You will need to purchase two for both sides of your dryer. They attach to the outer-most sides of the bearing. The manufacturer recommends replacing both slides at the same time. Take this opportunity to clean out the lint and dust in the dryer, to keep it running smoothly. This is a genuine replacement part that comes directly from the manufacturer. This item is sold individually. The part attaches to the outermost side of the bearing. Although this part is denoted as being \"Green\" in its title, many users and technicians have noted that its true colour is closer to a dark gray or black.\\nPrice: $14.29\\nStock: In Stock\\nProduct_link: /PS6447706-GE-WE1M1067-Drum-Bearing-Slide-Green-Sold-individually.htm?SourceCode=18\\nSymptoms Fixed: Noisy | Marks left on clothes\\nReplacements List: [\\'AP5668531\\', \\'2677745\\', \\'WE1M1067\\', \\'WE01M0316\\', \\'WE1M316\\', \\'WE1M481\\', \\'WE1M507\\']\\nProduct Info: General Electric, Hotpoint, Kenmore.\\nAverage Product Rating: 4.9\\nAverage Repair Rating: 3.6 / 5.0, 174 reviews.\\nQueries: [\\'Looking to replace the green and the white glides but forget which went where, can you give me rough positioning?This is for model number Model number not found\\', \\'how many of these do I need to order to replace the green drum slides and how many come in a packageThis is for model number Model number not found\\', \\'Drum bearing slides: What is the difference between the Green, and the white drum bearing slides?This is for model number DX4500EE1WW\\', \"Hello, my front bearing and bearing slides are completely worn out.
